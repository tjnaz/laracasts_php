# Learning PHP with Laracasts

Welcome to my personal repository! This repo serves as a space for me to store and organize my notes and projects as I learn PHP through [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/).

## About This Repo

As I progress through the PHP courses on Laracasts, I will be adding new notes and code examples that I find useful or interesting. This repo might also include submodules for projects that I work on during my learning journey.

## Structure

The repo is organized into folders for each PHP course or topic I cover. Within each folder, you'll find separate files for notes and code examples.
